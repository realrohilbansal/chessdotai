To install and run on your machine:
- Go to a local folder and run `git clone https://github.com/realrohilbansal/chessdotai.git`
- Create a virtual environment (I prefer using miniconda)
- Activating that virtual env, run command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required modules.
- In the folder, run the `src/main.py` using `python src/main.py`.
